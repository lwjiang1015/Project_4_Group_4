## Credit Card Eligibility Prediction Modelling

## Overview and Purpose
 This project aims to generate a well-performing predicting tool to predict the eligibility for a credit card given the historical assessment data. More specifically, we use the machine learning (ML) modelling tools, such as random forest modelling and neural network modelling, along with other techbologies such as Python Pandas in an attempt to generate a model to assess the eligibility for a credit card more accurately. The model generated may be of valuable to people who apply for a credit card to prepare in advance, for financial institutions who has not got their own modelling to assist with assessing the eligibility, and/or for other like-minded people who would like to exchange knowledge.

### Important Note

While the data used in this analysis presents promising results, it's important to note that the values within the DataFrame do not reflect current market conditions. Although the dataset has been cleaned up, with preprocessing steps applied to ensure data integrity, the exact origin or collection method of the dataset remains uncertain. This analysis serves the purpose of demonstrating the application of various models and evaluating their performance using available data. By providing transparency about the dataset's limitations and the purpose of the analysis, we aim to offer readers a clear understanding of the context and scope of this project.
